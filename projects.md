# Project Euler
Some solutions for [Project Euler Challenges](https://projecteuler.net/): [Repository](https://github.com/JlnZhou/ProjectEuler).  
I began coding in Python, and decided to continue from the 4th problem, in C++ in order to train myself.

# CentraleSupélec 2018/2019
In 2018/2019, I spent my last year at CentraleSupélec specializing in Applied Mathematics.   
These repositories are kind of messy and need to be tidied up, but if you are curious... Here they are, I warned you:

- [Deep Learning homework](https://github.com/JlnZhou/MVA_DeepLearning_2018_2019): Homework projects for a Deep Learning course.
- [Image segmentation](https://github.com/JlnZhou/Safran_projet): A little project which goal was to try get an unsupervised segmentation for X-ray scans of a composite material.
- [Sleep Stage Classification](https://github.com/JlnZhou/DreemSleepStageClassificationChallenge):  Homework for a Machine Learning course, I recently reworked on it.
