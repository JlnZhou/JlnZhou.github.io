# Work In Progress
I am currently working on several things as a hobby:
- [Google Kick Start 2020](https://github.com/JlnZhou/GoogleKickStart2020): Some problems of the 2020 edition for the [Google Kick Start Challenge](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart).
- [Google Kick Start 2021](https://github.com/JlnZhou/GoogleKickStart2021): Some problems of the 2021 edition for the [Google Kick Start Challenge](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart).
- [Challenge Data / Land cover predictive modeling from satellite images by Preligens](https://github.com/JlnZhou/ChallengeDataPreligens2021): A challenge from the [Challenge Data website of ENS and Collège de France](https://challengedata.ens.fr/).
- [Challenge Data / Reconstruction of Liquid Asset Performance by QRT](https://github.com/JlnZhou/ChallengeDataQRT2021): A challenge from the [Challenge Data website of ENS and Collège de France](https://challengedata.ens.fr/).

# CentraleSupélec 2018/2019
In 2018/2019, I spent my last year at CentraleSupélec specializing in Applied Mathematics.   
These repositories are kind of messy and need to be tidied up, but if you are curious... Here they are, I warned you:
- [Deep Learning homework](https://github.com/JlnZhou/MVA_DeepLearning_2018_2019): Homework projects for a Deep Learning course.
- [Image segmentation](https://github.com/JlnZhou/Safran_projet): A little project which goal was to try get an unsupervised segmentation for X-ray scans of a composite material.
- [Sleep Stage Classification](https://github.com/JlnZhou/DreemSleepStageClassificationChallenge):  Homework for a Machine Learning course.
