description: Who am I?
---
My name is Julien Zhou, I graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris, which recently became CentraleSup√©lec.
I am specialised in applied mathematics, and I am eager to work for the greater good. Currently, I am interested in different subjects, in climate change, in the way the economy works etc... and I am trying to gain knowledge about them.

PS: I am currently looking for professional opportunities. (you never know)
